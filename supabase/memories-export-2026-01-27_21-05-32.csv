I had seen all those perfect, creamy slices on YouTube and thought, how hard could it be?

I followed every step — crushed the biscuits, melted the butter, mixed the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla with more confidence than skill. It looked fine… until it didn’t.

Somewhere between the “bake for 45 minutes” and “let it cool,” things went downhill. The top cracked like dry land, the edges burnt a little, and the center wobbled like jelly that gave up hope. Still, I smiled, thinking maybe it would taste better than it looked.

When I served it to my family, they tried to keep straight faces — that’s when I knew it was bad. My mom said gently, “It’s... unique.” My dad laughed and said, “Next time, maybe try ice cream — it doesn’t need baking.”
